Sets minimum font width to normal and increases contrast between text and background if 
necessary.

Not very visible, but the Issues, Pull requests etc. have more contrast, as do the comments:

# Installation

 - Install Greasemonkey or equivalent
 - open the [text-contrast-corrections.user.js](https://github.com/JakubFojtik/text-contrast-corrections/raw/master/text-contrast-corrections.user.js) in browser and accept install prompt from 
Greasemonkey
 - if no install prompt appears, click GM logo, Add new script, then Edit the new script and copy 
the contents of [text-contrast-corrections.user.js](https://github.com/JakubFojtik/text-contrast-corrections/raw/master/text-contrast-corrections.user.js) there

# Todos

 - does not yet run on lazy-loaded content, e.g. here on GitHub the file view has to be reloaded for the script to work
 - does not notice partialy-transparent backgrounds, e.g. here on GitHub the number of Issues in the repository menu becomes white
 - does not save intermediate results
